These are the exact same examples as Dejan's Delphi
examples.  The .DFM files are in fact the same files.
Since C++ Builder does not always upgrade projects well,
so I enclosed separate projects for C++ Builder 3, 4
and 5.

The examples projects are built with the assumption
that the CPORT library was installed in a directory
called CPORT under the CBuilder main directory.  For
example, for a normal C++ Builder 3 installation,
CPORT would be installed in:

C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder3\CPORT.

If you did not install in this directory, you may need 
to modify the search path for the project.
